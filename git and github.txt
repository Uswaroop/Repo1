Git and github 

What is git ? 
     Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development.

What is GitHub ? 

       GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time. Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.

Who use ? 

     Developers use GitHub to work together on a single project with the benefit of version control. This helps them reduce duplicating work. Plus, GitHub allows developers to try new things. If the changes aren’t positive, they can easily revert back to the previous version.
